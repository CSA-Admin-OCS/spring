/**
 * Creates the assignment-to-creator ("lesson owner") join table for databases managed with
 * ddl-auto=none. Without this, AssignmentCreatorSyncService.applyCreators() fails with
 * "no such table: assignment_creators" the moment the Pages sync bot tries to set an
 * assignment's owners - the request 500s, the per-file sync safety net
 * (create_assignments_from_frontmatter.py) logs and swallows it as a warning rather than
 * failing the run, and the creators list silently never gets written. A teacher who set
 * assignment_creator_uids in frontmatter would see the sync "succeed" overall while the
 * student(s) they named never actually show up as owners anywhere.
 *
 * Mirrors AssignmentCourseGroupsMigration exactly (same sibling join-table problem, same
 * fix) - assignment_person (assignedGraders) and assignment_course_groups already exist on
 * every environment that predates ddl-auto=none or already had this migration; this table
 * was the one left out.
